Building an RPM
=================================================================
RPMs are built from a tagged snapshot of all repositories in GIT.
In most cases these tags refer to sprints. Alternatively 'HEAD'
can be used to checkout from the main Trunk, which is Dev.

The build script requires a revision number of the RPM. This
corresponds to the number of the RPM build for the given tag. For
example, if this is the third RPM built and distributed for
Sprint-124, then the revision number would be '003'.

The build script also requires a repository type 'git'.
 
To start RPM generation:

$ [ -e ~/rpmbuild/ ] && mv ~/rpmbuild ~/rpmbuild.back
$ cp -r aGiovanni/Dev-Tools/other/rpmbuild ~/rpmbuild
$ cd ~/rpmbuild

Building a new giovanni4 RPM
build_rpm_for_g4.sh use the following documentation

$ ./build_rpm_for_g4.sh $repo $version $revision $opt_partner_flag  # replace these vars; 
$opt_partner_flag is an optional argument that can be used to install a specific package
such as a Tier 2 partner like jpl or podaac.

Examples:
$ ./build_rpm_for_g4.sh Sprint-135 4.21 1
$ ./build_rpm_for_g4.sh dev 4.19 1
$ ./build_rpm_for_g4.sh master 4.19 2
$ ./build_rpm_for_g4.sh Sprint-104 4.22 1 podaac
$ ./build_rpm_for_cloud.sh Sprint-114 4.21 002 jpl

End of documentation for build_rpm_for_g4.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------
Building a new RPM for a specific package
build_rpm_for_admin_tools.sh please adhere to the following:

Note: The following build script is for installing giovanni4 Admin Tools
Alternately, build_rpm_for_admin_tools.sh it could be used to install any
package as long as there is a corresponding SPEC file. For example:

$ ./build_rpm_for_admin_tools.sh $branch_name $rev $package

# Args
branch_name=$1 # Where branch_name is the git Branch you are building from
rev=$2 # Where rev is the revision number of the RPM
package=$3 # Where package is the package your are installing ie. agiovanni_admin

Example:
$ ./build_rpm_for_admin_tools.sh Sprint-135 001 agiovanni_admin

The SPEC file should be called agiovanni_admin.spec.template

The output of the RPM generation will be located in a
subdirectory of ~/rpmbuild/RPMS based on your system architecture.
