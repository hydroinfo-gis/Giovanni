These are the directions on how to create the Non-Javascript Portal:
Build in this directory and in ../xsl and in ../cgi

This is the second version of the 508 Portal. This now is structured:
noscript.cgi on top on NoScript.pm with a few .xsl files.
It relies on
my $template = "../../giovanni/noscript/noscriptTemplate.html";
my $servicesXml = "cfg/giovanni/giovanni_services.xml";
